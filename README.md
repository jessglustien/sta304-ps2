# Social Factors Influencing Age At First Birth

This paper examines different possible factors that can affect the age a woman gives birth to her first child at.
Using data collected in the 2017 GSS, a multiple regression model was created to examine the relationship
between womenâ€™s marital status, education level, total number of children, and the age that the first child
was born at. This model showed a negative relationship between total number of children and age at first
birth, and a positive relationship between the level of education achieved and the age at first birth. A strong
correlation was not found between marital status and age at first birth.
